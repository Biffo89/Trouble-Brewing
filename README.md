# Trouble Brewing
This plugin displays information about the number of pieces of eight earned during a Trouble Brewing game.
Players will earn up to 100 pieces of eight through contribution, and a further 10 for every bottle of rum their team
produces. Although the OSRS wiki states that players must contribute to be eligible for pieces of eight from rum,
through personal testing, I have found that players may receive pieces of eight with no contribution at all.
